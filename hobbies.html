<h1> Hobbies!</h1>
<hr />
<h2><p>In my free time, I love to read manga, watch anime, play video games, develop video games, </br>
take my dog for walks around the park, and spending quality time with my wife.</br></p></h2>
<h2><p>I've been working on a few small games via tutorials and have had a lot of fun with it.</br>
     I'm still in the process of working on furthering my skills when it comes to indie development. </br>
     However, I'm excited to see where I will go and how far my skills will grow. </br>
