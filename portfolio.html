       <p class= "description"> When I first got started in game development, I found an incredible tutorial online on making 2D games. </br>
        To get my feet wet, I decided to hop into the tutorial and loved every second of it. Seeing every line I wrote </br>
        come to life was a rush I had never felt before. Once I had finished the tutorial, I decided to take it a step further and </br>
        added sound effects and music, options for audio settings, a start menu, etc. I truly felt like I was in my craft. </br>
        I've since moved on from this project and have worked on a few other small projects, but nothing as finished as this one. </br>
